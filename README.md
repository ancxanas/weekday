# Weekday

This project is a website where you can search for job listings. It's made using ReactJs, Redux, and CSS. You can easily find jobs, filter them, and keep scrolling to see more without having to click any buttons. Each job listing shows the job title, company name, location, a short description, experience needed, and a button to apply.
